## 1. Goal
This category is about how to plan the shortest path from the obtained map. The map could be point cloud format, or 2D grid map format. However, in our main [flowchart](https://v-slammers.github.io/categories/Indoor_AR_Navigation/), there is a stage that converts PCL to Grid map. So, in this category, we assume that the map should be 2D grid map. Therefore, this category will describe how to find the shortest path from the 2D grid map.

## 2. Process
At first, we did research of path planning algorithms. Then, to see the feasibility, we compared some of them via some great open source software. In this step, we used our own grid map based on KITTI dataset. Then, we tried to optimize the performance in order to run it in real-time world environment.

For the first step(research), we will add reference sites instead of posting all of the path planning algorithms.
