This post is about LDSO code review introduction

## LDSO Code Review

### Goal

  In this chapter, we are going to review the LDSO code and understand it in depth. Our final goal is to modularize the LDSO code and to use some parts of it. Most of all, we need localization function for our project.

 

### Role

  Our team members divide the code into 4 sections at first, and are responsible for each part. We select 4 granularities that needs to be studied with much effort and background knowledge, PixelSelector2, Undistort, CoarseInitializer, and CoarseTracker. 4 members who are responsible for those parts are as follows.

- PixelSelector2 - [YoungJ-Baek](https://github.com/YoungJ-Baek)
- Undistort - [jeonjw25](https://github.com/jeonjw25)
- CoarseInitializer - [jeongmyunglee](https://github.com/jeongmyunglee)
- CoarseTracker - [HeejoonLee](https://github.com/HeejoonLee)



### In this chapter
  In this chapter, I will post all the code review and description of PixelSelector2. Of course, you can find the same content at our official blog. Moreover, I will post other sections' summary and related links, too. However, details about other sections are at our official blog.
