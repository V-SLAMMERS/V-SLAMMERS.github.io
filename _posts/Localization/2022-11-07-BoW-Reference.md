## 1. Purpose

To test loop detection in LDSO, we have to do deep dive on bag-of-words. Furthermore, we are going to use open source library including `DBoW3`.

## 2. Open Source Library

[DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2 "@embed")

## 3. Action Item

Today, we decide to develop test code for loop closing. At this time, we decide to make 4 different codes for trials and errors. So, all the four members will develop test code for loop closing.

## 4. Next Agenda

Next time, we will check the status of test code development. Our first goal is to detect loop closing with the test code. So, we will compare each codes and combine them into our common code.
